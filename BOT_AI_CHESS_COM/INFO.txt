Still under development for other boards, pieces, colors or tkinter for displaying the game board. 
Haven't yet tried other sites or links from chess.com The soft most probably can solve puzzles. 
It can also play vs other people but this is sort of cheating. Have also a big database from 
chessbase 11 game that I could try to integrate. Most of the commands from main program are quite 
new to me, the ones moving the mouse or detecting the board, but I understood how it works.  
Also FEN display of the chessboard is shown in PyCharm terminal. For best view, open the website and 
PyCharm on half of screen both. Still not sure if I will use the Stockfish engine to adapt it on other 
sites or playing with itself, or I will only do a presentation of best games in history with undo 
button, play and fast forward. I have to fix some bugs also as it doesn't start from move 1 if he is 
with white. You have to make the first move and then leave him to play.
